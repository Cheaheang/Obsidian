If you are interested in Asp .Net Core Web API and have less time to learn, you can focus on:

- Sections 1 to 7

- Sections 12 to 15

- Section 18

- Sections 20 to 25 (optional, but requires some basic knowledge in MVC controllers and views)

- Sections 26 to 30 (Web API and Minimal API)

But note that the skipped sections are also logically related to web api (such as unit testing etc.,). So you should come back in the near future.
